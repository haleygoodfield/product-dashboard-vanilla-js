# Product Dashboard 
This is my sixteenth coding challenge. Here, I will create a **Product Dashboard** for a business using **HTML, CSS, and Javascript**, by allowing users to fetch and display a list of products from an external API.
This scenario will be split into 4 Tasks: 
+ Task 1: Set Up the Project Structure
+ Task 2: Fetch Products with .then()
+ Task 3: Fetch Products with async/await
+ Task 4: Display the Products
+ Task 5: Reusable Error Handler
+ Task 6: Call Your Fetch Functions
